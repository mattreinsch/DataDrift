                    <p>Text preprocessing is critical for effective NLP. The steps include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tokenization:</strong> Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stop Words Removal:</strong> Filtering out common words like "and", "the", and "is" that do not contribute to the model&apos;s understanding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stemming/Lemmatization:</strong> Reducing words to their root forms to normalize the text.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <pre><code class="language-python">
    from nltk.corpus import stopwords
    from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
    from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
    
    text = "Natural language processing with Python is amazing!"
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    filtered_tokens = [w for w in tokens if not w.lower() in stopwords.words("english")]
    stemmed_tokens = [PorterStemmer().stem(w) for w in filtered_tokens]
                    </code></pre>
    
                    <h3>Model Architecture</h3>
